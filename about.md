Hello.
======

I'm winocm, a regular old software developer who loves to develop for embedded devices, especially ones
based on ARM.

## Experience

I have experience with the following languages:

* x86/x64 Assembly
* PowerPC Assembly
* ARM Assembly
* C
* Objective-C
* C/C++ 

## Projects

Here are at least some of them:

* boot.efi, a booter for Darwin/ARM for ARM UEFI systems.
* Porting the Darwin kernel to ARMv7/v8 architecture.
* Porting TianoCore and other firmware/open-source bootloaders to proprietary ARM systems. (iPhone 4, HP TouchPad)
* MachBoot, a threaded bootloader for Darwin.
* GenericBooter, a shim bootloader for u-boot to start the Darwin kernel.
* opensn0w, a generic utility for bootstrapping unsigned code on iPhone based platforms.
* [p0sixspwn](http://p0sixspwn.com), an iOS 6.1.3, 6.1.4 and 6.1.5 untethered jailbreak.

Most of these projects are open-source and are available on my [GitHub](http://github.com/winocm) repositories.

## Contact

I can be reached on IRC for the most part. Feel free to contact me.

* `winocm` on Freenode.
* `winocm AT icloud DOT com` works too.
* `winocm AT jabber DOT ccc DOT de` works for XMPP/GoogleTalk/Jabber/whatever-it-is-nowadays.

(Please do not email me for technical support, I will not respond. Especially if it's about printers. Raise a support 
ticket with @nickdepetrillo and @thegrugq for that.)
