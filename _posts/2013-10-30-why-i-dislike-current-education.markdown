This post is made out of mostly personal experience. If you don't want to read about how broken
the educational system is in America, or what my own experiences are, then feel free to skip this
article. If not, feel free to keep reading.

# Test early, test often!

Standardized testing has really helped to kill creativity. In the city where I live at least, too many
people focus on tests and not on various other projects. There's too many people who only care about
getting the good grades for a university. After all, it's the only path to success, right?

As a programmer, I have much more fun working on operating system kernels than I do working on a random
physics problem or writing yet another English essay. The subject that I like to mess with gives me
such extreme curiosity that it does outweigh the 'fun' that other classes seem to give. 

Memorization of facts is incredibly important, at least according to the CollegeBoard. Many AP courses,
being called 'college-level', require the student to memorize vast quantities of information. From
first hand experience in AP Computer Science, for example, doing things in a different and unique
way is not tolerated. Everything must follow the standard rigidity set by the instructor. That's not 
right.

These tests and forced memorization don't truly help children. They won't ever know how to solve issues
using their own minds. The entire information paradigm has changed, moving from one of remembering 
information to rather, finding and utilizing information.

# Busywork

Busywork doesn't help people excel. It only serves to waste time. Imagine how much paper would be saved
if educators didn't print out huge packets only for people to fill them out and learn nothing. For example,
in the past, I had a certain Spanish teacher that printed out large packets of information. Her entire class
involved filling out that stupid packet and performing 'activities' daily.

Worksheets are evil.

# Lack of responsibility

A side effect of high rigidity is one of stupidity. Certain members of society believe that is incredibly 
'cool' to act stupid. This irritates me to no end. There's no accountability in this sect of our community. 

Additionally, the lack of accountable teachers does not help. (Certain people also love to overly micromanage
every single aspect of their class too). This needs to change.

# Lack of choice

If people actually do have a certain interest, we should at least cherish them instead of forcing them
to be brought down in the entire system. If I were a standard old teenager who didn't know anything about
anything and just asked 'omg how to teach of prisonbrake' daily, things would be far different. Unfortunately,
that's not the case.

I've been put down far too much by people who think minimum wage is a good thing. And by people who think that
without education, you'll be living a minimum wage life.

I highly must thank the entire community that exists. I wouldn't be doing what I currently am without them.

(Thank you Will.)
